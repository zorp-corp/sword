;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.

alloc demo:

- in a loop, alloc blocks of 100M up to 1T
- store /dev/urandom data in each alloc
- crc32 checksum the data. store pointer, alloc size, and event number
  in write-ahead log

- each time process is started:
  - validation: lookup event number. validate checksums of data up to
    current event number. Free WAL nodes with higher event numbers
    (assert none > 1 of current)
  - allocation: allocate more random data
  - sync intermittently

- params to alloc-demo:
  - max allocation size
  - switch to disable alloc validation
  - (hardcode for now) alloc size (or random?)

- add random process crashing. Write C program runner or do it in bash
  
- add random freeing. Maybe implement as a separate process?
